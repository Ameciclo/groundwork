## üìã Next Steps (To Do)

### Immediate (Required)
- [ ] **Update Repository URL**
  - File: `azure/kubernetes/kong/argocd-application.yaml`
  - Change: `repoURL: https://github.com/yourusername/groundwork`
  - Replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username

- [ ] **Commit and Push to Git**
  ```bash
  cd /home/plpbs/Projetos/Ameciclo/groundwork
  git add azure/kubernetes/
  git commit -m "feat: Add Kong GitOps configuration for ArgoCD"
  git push origin main
  ```

- [ ] **Create ArgoCD Application**
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f azure/kubernetes/kong/argocd-application.yaml
  ```

- [ ] **Monitor Kong Deployment**
  ```bash
  argocd app get kong
  kubectl get pods -n kong
  kubectl logs -n kong -l app.kubernetes.io/name=kong
  ```

### Short-term (Recommended)
- [ ] **Verify Kong is Running**
  - Check Kong proxy: `curl http://10.20.1.4:8001/status`
  - Access Kong Manager: `http://10.20.1.4:8002`
  - Access ArgoCD: `http://10.20.1.4:80`

- [ ] **Deploy Atlas Microservices**
  - Create ArgoCD application for Atlas
  - Use files in `azure/kubernetes/atlas/`
  - Configure Kong routes to microservices

- [ ] **Configure Kong Routes**
  - Set up routes for cyclist-profile service
  - Set up routes for cyclist-counts service
  - Set up routes for traffic-deaths service

- [ ] **Test API Gateway**
  - Test Kong proxy with sample requests
  - Verify routing to microservices
  - Check response times

### Medium-term (Enhancement)
- [ ] **Add Monitoring**
  - Deploy Prometheus for metrics
  - Deploy Grafana for visualization
  - Set up alerts

- [ ] **Implement Secrets Management**
  - Use Kubernetes secrets for sensitive data
  - Consider external secrets operator
  - Rotate credentials regularly

- [ ] **Set up CI/CD Pipeline**
  - Configure GitHub Actions
  - Automate testing
  - Automate deployments

- [ ] **Enable TLS/SSL**
  - Configure certificates
  - Set up certificate renewal
  - Enable HTTPS for all services

- [ ] **Implement RBAC**
  - Configure Kubernetes RBAC
  - Set up service accounts
  - Restrict permissions

## üöÄ Quick Commands

```bash
# View Kong status
argocd app get kong

# Sync Kong manually
argocd app sync kong

# View Kong logs
kubectl logs -n kong -l app.kubernetes.io/name=kong

# Check Kong pods
kubectl get pods -n kong

# Test Kong
curl http://10.20.1.4:8001/status

# View all applications
kubectl get applications -n argocd

# SSH to K3s VM
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa azureuser@20.172.9.53
```

## üí° Tips

1. **Always commit before making changes**
   - ArgoCD watches Git, so commit first
   - Changes are automatically synced

2. **Use ArgoCD UI for monitoring**
   - Visual status of all applications
   - Easy to see what's deployed
   - One-click sync if needed

3. **Keep documentation updated**
   - Update docs when adding new services
   - Keep credentials in secure location
   - Document any custom configurations

4. **Monitor resource usage**
   - Check RAM and CPU regularly
   - Scale up if needed
   - Monitor costs

5. **Test before deploying**
   - Test YAML files locally
   - Use `kubectl apply --dry-run`
   - Verify in dev before production

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Repository URL**: Must be updated in `argocd-application.yaml`
- **Credentials**: Keep PostgreSQL password secure
- **Firewall Rules**: Already configured for K3s subnet
- **Cost**: ~$47/month (well under budget)
- **RAM**: 85% available for microservices

---

## üéØ Success Criteria

Your setup is successful when:
- ‚úÖ Kong pods are running
- ‚úÖ Kong can connect to PostgreSQL
- ‚úÖ ArgoCD shows Kong as "Synced"
- ‚úÖ Kong proxy responds to requests
- ‚úÖ Kong manager UI is accessible
- ‚úÖ All changes are tracked in Git
