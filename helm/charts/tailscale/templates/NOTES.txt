1. Tailscale Operator has been deployed successfully!

2. Verify the operator is running:
  kubectl get pods -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}
  kubectl logs -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} -l app.kubernetes.io/name=tailscale-operator

3. Make sure you have created the Tailscale auth secret:
  kubectl create secret generic tailscale-auth \
    --from-literal=key=<your-auth-key> \
    -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

4. To expose a service via Tailscale, add this annotation:
  annotations:
    tailscale.com/expose: "true"

  Example:
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Service
  metadata:
    name: my-service
    annotations:
      tailscale.com/expose: "true"
  spec:
    type: ClusterIP
    ports:
      - port: 80
        targetPort: 8080
    selector:
      app: my-app

5. Access exposed services from any Tailscale node:
  - Services will be accessible at: <service-name>.<cluster-name>.ts.net
  - Check your Tailscale admin console for the cluster name
